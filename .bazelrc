# BUILD TROUBLESHOOTING
# **********************************
# These settings make it easier to figure out why a build may not have gone as expected.
# By setting test_output=errors, we get the error output directly in stdout (instead of just
# a link to a log file). The explain parameter outputs the build plan for the last build,
# which can be somewhat helpful if you wonder why some packages get rebuilt.
